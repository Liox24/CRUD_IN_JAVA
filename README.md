Features
Create Record:

Add a new record to the file in a tabular format.
Data fields include ID, Name, and Email.
Read Records:

Display all records in a well-formatted table-like structure.
The data in records.txt is synchronized with the console output.
Update Record:

Modify an existing record identified by a unique ID.
Rewrites the file while maintaining proper formatting.
Delete Record:

Efficiently delete a specific record by ID using a temporary file-based approach to reduce memory and performance overhead.
Ensures the integrity of the remaining records.
File Structure
records.txt:

Acts as the main data store.
Maintains a tabular format with headers and separators:
markdown
Copy code
ID         | Name                 | Email                       
-------------------------------------------------------------
123456     | John Doe             | john.doe@example.com        
654321     | Jane Smith           | jane.smith@example.com      
Temporary File (temp_records.txt):

Used during delete and update operations to handle changes without modifying the original file until operations are confirmed.
Technical Highlights
File Handling:

Uses BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for efficient read/write operations.
Includes safeguards to ensure file integrity, such as using a temporary file during modifications.
Formatted Output:

Data is displayed in a clear, tabular format in both the console and records.txt.
Object-Oriented Design:

Record class encapsulates individual record details (ID, Name, Email) and includes utility methods for string conversion and parsing.
Scalability:

Optimized for large datasets using line-by-line processing and a temporary file-based approach for deletion.
How to Use
Run the Program:

Compile and execute the CRUDOperations class.
Choose an Option:

The program displays a menu:
mathematica
Copy code
CRUD Operations Menu:
1. Create Record
2. Read All Records
3. Delete Record
4. Exit
Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired operation.
View Results:

All changes are reflected in both the console output and records.txt.
Example Workflow
Create a Record:

Input:
mathematica
Copy code
Enter ID: 101
Enter Name: Alice Johnson
Enter Email: alice.johnson@example.com
Result in records.txt:
markdown
Copy code
ID         | Name                 | Email                       
-------------------------------------------------------------
101        | Alice Johnson        | alice.johnson@example.com
Delete a Record:

Input:
arduino
Copy code
Enter ID of the record to delete: 101
Result in records.txt:
markdown
Copy code
ID         | Name                 | Email                       
-------------------------------------------------------------
(No records found.)
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Basic understanding of Java programming.
Future Enhancements
Add search functionality to find records by name or email.
Implement soft delete (mark records as deleted instead of physically removing them).
Add validation for duplicate IDs.
Introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
